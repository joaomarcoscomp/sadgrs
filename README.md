# Decision Support System Based on Artificial Intelligence for Solid Waste Management

## Design of a Decision Support System, based on Artificial Intelligence algorithms, developed to assist decision makers in the area of solid waste.

The system was created based on artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms, which makes it capable of making accurate predictions about the amount and characterization of waste generated.

For the creation of this system, a field survey was carried out in the city of Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, where data regarding the generation of solid waste in 158 households were collected. The collected data were used to build prediction models through regression and classification techniques.

The following models were developed:

* Neural Network - for regression -
* Decision Tree
* Naive Bayes
* KNN
* SVM

The interface was build using an open source framework called streamlit.
